# TCP FUN

## Description
* This is a simple TCP server that allows for multiple connections and transmits a secret text file over tcp to a client.

## System Requirements
* Node (I use 14.7.0)
* npm (I use 6.14.7)
* everything else should just come with the build

## Running Instructions
* To build: `npm run prepublish`
* To run the server: `npm start`
* To run the client: `npm run client`
* To run tests: `npm tests` (not great coverage)
